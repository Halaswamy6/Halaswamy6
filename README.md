## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi there! I’m a passionate Computer Engineering graduate with a strong interest in Java-based software development and web technologies.

💻 I’ve built several real-world projects, including:

A Console-based Money Transfer System with transaction management

An ATM Simulation Application

A Student Login and Course Enrollment Portal using JSP, Servlets, and MySQL

🌐 I also hold a Web Development Certification and enjoy building user-focused applications that blend clean design with strong backend logic.

⚙️ Beyond software, I have hands-on experience in electronics and IoT, having secured 1st place in my college for the Smart Hydroponic Irrigation System project.

🚀 I’m always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate on open-source projects, and grow as a full-stack developer.
